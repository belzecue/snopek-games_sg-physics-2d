			<description>
				Returns a list of overlapping [SGCollisionObject2D]s.
				If the [code]sort[/code] argument is set to [code]true[/code], the list will be sorted by scene tree order. Normally, this is what you want because it ensures the results are in a deterministic order, however, there is a performance cost. So, if the order of the results isn't important in a particular case (ex. if you are simply checking the number of results) then you can set it to [code]false[/code].
